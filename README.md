Here's a suggested README text for your Iris flower classification project on GitHub:

```markdown
# Iris Flower Classification with Neural Network

This project includes a neural network model for classifying Iris flowers into three different species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. The project consists of four main files: `model.py`, `train.py`, `run.py`, and `config.py`.

## Files

- `model.py`: This file contains the definition of the neural network model.
- `train.py`: This file includes the code for training the model using the training dataset.
- `run.ipynb`: This file contains the code for running the trained model to predict the classification of new Iris flowers.
- `config.py`: This file includes the settings and configurations required for training and running the model.

## Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model

To train the model, run the `train.py` file:

```bash
python train.py
```

### 3. Run the Model

To run the model and predict the classification of new Iris flowers, execute the `run.py` file:

```bash
python run.py
```

## Configuration

The settings and configurations required for training and running the model are located in the `config.py` file. You can edit this file to apply your desired settings.
